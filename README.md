## Overview
The entire RISC I architecture has been meticulously recreated using Logisim Evolution, providing a robust platform for educational purposes.

An assembler, written in C#, has been developed to translate assembly language into machine code that can be directly read by the simulation model.

## Features
- Complete RISC I Simulation: A faithful recreation of the RISC I architecture in Logisim Evolution.

- Custom Assembler: A powerful assembler written in C# for converting assembly language into executable code for the simulator.

- Educational Focus: Designed to be a comprehensive teaching tool for learning about computer architecture.

## Getting Started
To get started with the simulation and assembler, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Logisim Evolution project file to explore the RISC I architecture.

3. Use the provided C# assembler to compile assembly code into machine code for the simulator.
